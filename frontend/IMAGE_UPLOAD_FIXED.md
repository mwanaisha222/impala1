## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Image Optimization:**

1. **Resize** to reasonable size (1200px wide max)
2. **Compress** to reduce file size (use TinyPNG)
3. **Format** as JPG or WebP for better performance

### **Image Hosting Services:**

| Service | Free Tier | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Imgur | Unlimited | Quick uploads |
| Cloudinary | 25GB | Professional use |
| Firebase Storage | 5GB | Integrated solution |
| Your Server | Depends | Full control |

### **URL Best Practices:**

✅ **Good URLs:**
```
https://i.imgur.com/abc123.jpg
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sample.jpg
https://example.com/images/article.png
```

❌ **Bad URLs:**
```
https://example.com/gallery?id=123  ← Not direct link
https://example.com/page.html       ← HTML page, not image
C:\Users\Desktop\image.jpg          ← Local path
```
